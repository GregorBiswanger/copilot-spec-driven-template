# Copilot instructions file rules

- Keep this file short, structured, and easy to scan.
- Maintain the **Style & Output Preferences** section as a living record.
- Keep the `architecture:` snapshot synchronized with the repo structure.
- `DocLanguage` controls the language of project documentation (Memory Bank + specs).
