# Specs

Specs live under `.github/specs/` and are organized by lifecycle stage:

- `.github/specs/backlog/` — ideas and not-yet-started specs
- `.github/specs/active/` — specs currently being implemented
- `.github/specs/done/` — implemented specs with passing acceptance criteria

Each spec should declare its status near the top:

`**Status:** Draft | In Progress | Implemented | Deprecated`

The documentation language is controlled by `DocLanguage` in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
(default English until `/setupSpecs` sets it).
